mineral-deposit-segmentation-pipeline
=====================================

A pipeline for segmenting mineral deposits on clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes of the brain [1,2,3,4].

The pipeline was originally developed at the Brain Imaging Research Centre [5] as part of a PhD project supported by SINAPSE/Spirit [6] on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [7] and Matlab 2011b [8].

Requirements:
- Recent Linux distribution that with Bash [9] and Perl [10] and
  utilities such as make, rsync and common command line utilities. 
- FMRIB FSL library [11]
- N4 intensity inhomogeneity correction tool [12] e.g. from Slicer3 [13]
- Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image in MATLAB [14]
- LIBRA: a Matlab library for robust analysis [15]
