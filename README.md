mineral-deposit-segmentation-pipeline
=====================================

A pipeline for segmenting mineral deposits [0] on clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes of the brain [1,2,3,4].

The pipeline was originally developed at the Brain Imaging Research Centre [5] as part of a PhD project supported by SINAPSE/Spirit [6] on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [7] and Matlab 2011b [8].

Requirements:
- Recent Linux distribution (e.g. Neurodebian [9]) with Bash [10] and Perl [11] and common utilities, such as make and rsync. 
- FMRIB FSL library [12]
- N4 intensity inhomogeneity correction tool [13] e.g. from Slicer3 [14]
- Tools for writing and reading NIfTI and ANALYZE image in MATLAB [15]
- LIBRA: a Matlab library for robust analysis [16]
- Parallel Matlab Toolbox [17]

How to test just the segmentation method (MATLAB script without the pipeline)?
To demonstrate how segmentation method works a MATLAB script 'segment_us_phantom.m' is provided in ${GITROOTDIR}/libBRIC/mineral-deposit-segmentation/test/ that segments the lesions of our lesion phantom. The structural T1- and T2*-weighted volumes of the lesion phantom can be found in ${GITROOTDIR}/libBRIC/mineral-deposit-segmentation/lesionphantom, where the script will place its output as well.

Steps for running the script:
- cd /to/some/new/directory
- download and extract NIFTI[15] and LIBRA[16] toolboxes for MATLAB
- git clone git@github.com:aglatz/mineral-deposit-segmentation-pipeline.git
- cd libBRIC/mineral-deposit-segmentation/
- run the following matlab commands:
* addpath('../misc-matlab/'); % include local library
* addpath('NIFTI/'); % include NIFTI toolbox functions
* addpath('LIBRA/'); % include LIBRA toolbox functions
* RoiLabelTable={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; % define ROI labes of interest
* [Ret] = segment_us_single('lesionphantom', RoiLabelTable, 'class', 1, [1 0], true); % Run segmentation on the lesion phantom volumes
- cd lesionphantom
- fslview -m single GRE_restore.nii.gz T1W_restore.nii.gz NonTis_mask.nii.gz NormTis_mask.nii.gz T2swHypo_mask.nii.gz # to view the masks
- ../../misc-scripts/ps2pdfAll.sh # converts the *.ps files into *.pdf files
- acroread class.pdf # to look at the stats

The last three volumes of the last command were generated by the software. The volumes are:
- GRE_restore is the biasfield corrected T2*-weighted volume
- T1W_restore is the biasfield corrected T1-weighted volume
- NonTis_mask is the mask that selects voxels that were classified as non normal-appearing tissue
- NormTis_mask is the mask that selects voxels that were classified as normal-appearing tissue
- T2swHypo_mask.nii.gz is the mask that selects the lesions of the lesion phantom.

Once you did that I would recommend that you try out the software on co-registered T1- and T2*-weighted volumes of a single subject of your study. You should used the script 'segment_us_mp.m' for that. It uses the pMatlab [17] library. You also could use pSegment_us.m directly after some modifications.
